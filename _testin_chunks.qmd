following code puts all python, md and qmd into a text file. 
 - Will target the streamlit_app folder
 - purpose is to Control F and serach for all instencies of a string/text/variable 


```{python}
#  following code puts all python, md and qmd into a text file. 
import os

# Target folder
folder_path = r"C:/git/math488/fa25_hafb/streamlit_app"

output_file = os.path.join(folder_path, "combined_files.txt")

# File extensions in the order to combine
extensions = [".py", ".md", ".qmd"]

with open(output_file, "w", encoding="utf-8") as outfile:
    for ext in extensions:
        # List only top-level files in the folder
        for file in sorted(os.listdir(folder_path)):
            if file.lower().endswith(ext):
                file_path = os.path.join(folder_path, file)
                outfile.write(f"\f\n===== {file} =====\n\n")  # Page break + header
                with open(file_path, "r", encoding="utf-8") as infile:
                    outfile.write(infile.read())
                    outfile.write("\n\n")

print(f"Combined file created at: {output_file}")
```
